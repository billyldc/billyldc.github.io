Hi, I'm Dongchen Li, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Hong Kong, advised by Prof. Zhiyi Huang. My research interests include online algorithms, approximate algorithms, and automated algorithm design. I am currently working on the prophet inequality and automated algorithm design. 


This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV.
